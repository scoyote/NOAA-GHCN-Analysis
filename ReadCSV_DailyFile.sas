The following information serves as a definition of each field in one line of data covering one station-day. Each field described below is separated by a comma ( , ) and follows the order
presented in this document.

ID = 11 character station identification code
YEAR/MONTH/DAY = 8 character date in YYYYMMDD format (e.g. 19860529 = May 29, 1986)
ELEMENT = 4 character indicator of element type 
DATA VALUE = 5 character data value for ELEMENT 
M-FLAG = 1 character Measurement Flag 
Q-FLAG = 1 character Quality Flag 
S-FLAG = 1 character Source Flag 
OBS-TIME = 4-character time of observation in hour-minute format (i.e. 0700 =7:00 am)

See section III of the GHCN-Daily readme.txt file for an explanation of ELEMENT codes and their units as well as the M-FLAG, Q-FLAGS and S-FLAGS.

The OBS-TIME field is populated with the observation times contained in NOAA/NCDCâ€™s Multinetwork Metadata System (MMS).
